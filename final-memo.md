# Data Analysis Project Memo

## Project Requirements
* A strong statement at the top. 
  * Tell me right up front what you found that was interesting or what you found that suggests a dynamite story. 
  * Tell me how your most newsworthy findings relate to what you found in your research about prior uses of similar data for stories elsewhere.
* A summary of the results of your analysis. 
  * Describe results that are germane to the main thrust of the story you are pitching 
  * relevant results that suggest other interesting avenues to explore. You may want to include graphics, tables or charts that will make it easier for me to grasp what you are trying to communicate. 
  * Indicate whether your findings are new or whether they present a local angle for similar findings reported elsewhere.
* Pros and cons of the data. 
  * Discuss both the strengths and limitations of the data.
  * How you would verify your findings: Identify the specific reporting and data steps would you take and the types of information you would use to determine whether the results of your analysis are accurate and significant. 
* Indicate the specific steps you would need to take to finish reporting the story.
  * Indicate whom you would need to contact for response to ensure that your reporting was fair and accurate.
  * Include the people you would contact and, if relevant, the places you would visit. Indicate how you would make the story real to readers. 
  * Construct a narrative example from one case based on as much information as you can draw from all of the tables that pertain to that case.

## Primary Findings

In many Virginia counties, black people are spending more time in prison than white people for committing the same crimes.

Across Virginia from 2007-2017, black people were sentenced to about a half year longer in prison than white people. But in individual counties, the difference was sometimes much greater.

Fifty-six of the 67 counties studied showed black people serving longer sentences than white. Southhampton was one of the worst offenders, with black people spending an average of 1.5 years longer behind bars. 

Of the remaining 11 counties, the greatest swing in the other direction — where white people spent longer in prison than black — was in Bedford, at about one year.

This analysis looked at sentence times for black and white people found guilty of a crime, adjusted for sentence suspensions. It also only considered counties with at least 1,000 of such cases and a 25 percent minimum percentage of cases in each of the two racial categories.
